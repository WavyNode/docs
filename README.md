## Overview 
We are building an API for electronic payment providers and cryptocurrency exchanges in Latin America. Our API monitors, analyzes, and detects transactions in real time to prevent fraud and money laundering, addressing a region with the 2nd highest cryptocurrency growth YoY.

Our solution identifies transactions and aligns with tax and regulatory frameworks like FATF, the Travel Rule, Mexico's Fintech Law, and other local regulations. Using AI agents, we generate detailed reports on user activity, conduct background checks, and provide risk scores through machine learning, automating investigations. 
This improves compliance and risk management for our clients across the region.
